    <!-- Content -->
    <div class="mla-content">
        <p><em>Citizen Kane</em>, directed by Orson Welles, is often called one of the greatest films ever made. Released in 1941, it tells the story of a man’s rise and fall, exploring themes of ambition, power, and loneliness. Even decades later, its innovative storytelling, visuals, and timeless themes continue to influence filmmakers and captivate audiences.</p>

        <p><strong>Plot Summary</strong></p>
        <p>The film begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles), a wealthy and powerful newspaper tycoon, whose last word is “Rosebud.” A journalist sets out to discover what Kane meant by this mysterious word, interviewing people who knew him. Through these interviews, Kane’s life unfolds in flashbacks. We see his rise from a poor boy to one of the richest and most influential men in the world, his failed marriages, his obsession with power, and, ultimately, his loneliness. By the end, the mystery of “Rosebud” is revealed, offering a bittersweet insight into what Kane truly valued.</p>

        <p><strong>Visual Style and Mood</strong></p>
        <p>One of the most striking things about <em>Citizen Kane</em> is its groundbreaking cinematography. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland used deep focus, meaning everything in the frame is in sharp detail, which draws the viewer’s eye to all parts of the scene. The movie also features dramatic low-angle shots that make Kane appear larger-than-life, emphasizing his power and dominance.</p>

        <p>The use of lighting and shadows is also brilliant, creating a sense of mystery and drama. Scenes often feature stark contrasts between light and dark, symbolizing Kane’s inner conflict and moral ambiguity. The sets, especially Kane’s massive and empty mansion Xanadu, feel cold and isolating, showing the emptiness of his life despite all his wealth.</p>

        <p><strong>Acting and Characters</strong></p>
        <p>Orson Welles delivers a powerful performance as Charles Foster Kane. He portrays Kane’s charm, ambition, and eventual decline with great depth, making the character both fascinating and tragic. Welles’ ability to show both the larger-than-life public figure and the deeply flawed, lonely man is what makes Kane such a memorable character.</p>

        <p>Joseph Cotten as Jedediah Leland, Kane’s best friend turned critic, gives a standout performance. Leland represents the moral conscience of the story, and his scenes with Kane are some of the most emotional and tense in the film. Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander, Kane’s second wife, also shines, showing her transformation from a hopeful young woman to someone broken by Kane’s control and ambition.</p>

        <p><strong>Themes and Meaning</strong></p>
        <p>At its core, <em>Citizen Kane</em> is about the cost of ambition and the emptiness of unchecked power. Kane’s relentless drive for success and control alienates everyone around him, leaving him wealthy but utterly alone. The film explores the idea that no amount of power or money can replace love and genuine human connection.</p>

        <p>The mystery of “Rosebud” ties into the theme of lost innocence. It represents Kane’s childhood and the simplicity and happiness he lost when he was taken away from his family. This theme resonates with audiences, showing that even the most powerful people long for something they can never have again.</p>

        <p><strong>Impact and Legacy</strong></p>
        <p><em>Citizen Kane</em> revolutionized filmmaking with its innovative techniques. Its use of deep focus, nonlinear storytelling, and dramatic visuals set a new standard for how movies could be made. Many of its techniques are still used today, making it a timeless piece of cinema.</p>

        <p>The film’s exploration of power, loneliness, and the human condition has influenced countless directors and movies. You can see its impact in everything from <em>There Will Be Blood</em> to <em>The Social Network</em>. It’s not just a movie—it’s a blueprint for how to tell complex, layered stories on screen.</p>

        <p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
        <p><em>Citizen Kane</em> isn’t just a movie—it’s an experience. Its rich story, brilliant performances, and groundbreaking techniques make it a must-watch for any film lover. Even if it feels a little slow or old-fashioned at times, its themes and emotional depth are still powerful today. It’s a film that challenges you to think about life, power, and what really matters.</p>
