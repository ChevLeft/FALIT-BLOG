    <!-- MLA Content (Body of the paper) -->
    <div class="mla-content">
        <p>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, directed by Robert Wiene, is often regarded as a cornerstone of early German
            Expressionism in cinema. Released in 1920, the film is a haunting exploration of madness, authority, and
            perception, and it remains an influential masterpiece in both the horror genre and the history of film
            itself.</p>

        <p><strong>Plot Overview</strong><br>
            The film opens with a seemingly disturbed young man, Francis (Friedrich Fehér), recounting a series of
            traumatic events. He tells the story of Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss), a mysterious and sinister figure who
            arrives in the town of Holstenwall with his somnambulist, Cesare (Conrad Veidt). Caligari exhibits Cesare,
            who can predict the future, in a carnival sideshow. Soon after their arrival, strange murders begin to take
            place, and Francis, along with his fiancée, Jane (Lil Dagover), becomes entangled in a nightmarish plot that
            spirals into psychological terror. As Francis delves deeper into uncovering the truth about Dr. Caligari,
            the film takes unexpected twists that challenge both the characters' and the audience's sense of reality.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Visual Style and Atmosphere</strong><br>
            What makes The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari iconic is its groundbreaking visual style. The film's sets are
            designed with harsh, jagged angles, distorted perspectives, and twisted architecture that defy naturalism.
            Walls slant unnaturally, doors are irregularly shaped, and shadows are painted directly onto the set, giving
            the film a nightmarish, dreamlike quality. This surreal landscape reflects the warped mental state of its
            characters and establishes a mood of paranoia and unease from the outset. The aesthetic choices are
            emblematic of German Expressionism, which sought to externalize inner emotions, particularly anxiety and
            fear, through stylized visuals.</p>

        <p>The film’s lighting is stark and high-contrast, adding to the sense of unreality. The interplay of light and
            shadow is central to its eerie atmosphere, with Cesare, the somnambulist, often shown creeping through
            darkened streets, his elongated silhouette crawling along walls. The film uses minimal props, allowing the
            exaggerated sets and makeup to dominate, creating an abstract, psychologically charged world. The
            artificiality of the environment reinforces the film’s central themes, leading to an unforgettable viewing
            experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Performances</strong><br>
            The performances in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari are highly theatrical and stylized, fitting seamlessly
            within the film’s expressionistic vision. Werner Krauss delivers a chilling performance as Dr. Caligari,
            embodying the mad doctor archetype with a manic energy that oscillates between unsettling control and wild
            instability. His exaggerated movements and sinister expressions make him an unforgettable villain, embodying
            authority run amok.</p>

        <p>Conrad Veidt as Cesare is equally captivating. As the sleepwalker, his lanky frame and minimal yet precise
            movements lend Cesare a ghostly, almost inhuman quality. Veidt’s wide, unblinking eyes and pallid makeup
            make him both mesmerizing and terrifying, a figure who moves with eerie silence yet holds the power of life
            and death. His famous scene where he kidnaps Jane, carrying her lifelessly through twisted streets, is one
            of the most iconic images in early cinema.</p>

        <p>Friedrich Fehér as Francis, while more restrained than Krauss or Veidt, offers a compelling portrait of a man
            caught between reason and madness. His earnest performance grounds the narrative, pulling the audience into
            the psychological horror as the story’s unreliable narrator.</p>

        <p><strong>Themes and Symbolism</strong><br>
            Beneath its strange visuals and haunting performances, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a film steeped in
            thematic complexity. It explores the dangers of unchecked authority, the thin line between sanity and
            madness, and the subjectivity of reality. Caligari represents the oppressive, authoritarian figure who
            manipulates others for his own ends, and Cesare is both his tool and victim. In this sense, the film can be
            read as an allegory of the socio-political climate in post-World War I Germany, where the traumas of war and
            the rise of authoritarianism loomed large.</p>

        <p>The film’s famous twist ending — revealing that much of the story may have been a delusion of Francis, who is
            in fact an inmate in an asylum — further complicates its narrative. This ending casts doubt on everything
            the audience has seen, making the viewer question the nature of truth and the reliability of perception. Is
            Caligari truly a malevolent figure, or is he simply a projection of Francis’ disturbed mind? This ambiguity
            makes the film a pioneer in the psychological thriller genre, prefiguring the use of unreliable narrators in
            cinema.</p>

        <p><strong>Legacy and Influence</strong><br>
            The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is not just a seminal work in the horror genre; it is one of the most
            influential films ever made. Its stylistic innovations set the stage for later horror and noir films,
            influencing directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, Tim Burton, and Guillermo del Toro. The film’s portrayal of
            psychological horror, where the terror comes as much from the mind as from external forces, paved the way
            for films like Psycho (1960) and Black Swan (2010).</p>

        <p>Its expressionistic visuals, characterized by angular set designs and distorted realities, have left an
            indelible mark on art and cinema. The film’s influence is evident in everything from the exaggerated
            mise-en-scène of later horror films to the modern fascination with the malleability of truth and perception
            in psychological thrillers.</p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
            The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a masterpiece that continues to resonate a century after its release. Its
            visual innovation, haunting performances, and thematic depth make it a film that transcends its time. It is
            both a product of its era and a timeless exploration of human fear, madness, and authority. For anyone
            interested in the origins of cinematic horror or the development of film as an art form, The Cabinet of Dr.
            Caligari is essential viewing.</p>
