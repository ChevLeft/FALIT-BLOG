        <p>Mise en scene means “placing on stage,” but in filmmaking, it’s everything you see in a scene. The lights, the set, the costumes, the props, and even how the actors are placed in the shot—all of it comes together to tell a story without saying a word. StudioBinder explains it as “everything in front of the camera, including the set design, lighting, and actors” (StudioBinder.com). Basically, every detail you see on screen has a purpose and helps set the mood or show what’s really going on. </p>
        
        <p>In *Rebecca*, the mise en scene is used to show how the new Mrs. de Winter feels about living in Manderley. The house is huge, but it still feels empty and overwhelming. The rooms are dark and shadowy, making it seem like Rebecca’s memory is everywhere. You see her initials on her belongings, and it’s like she’s still in the house, even though she’s gone. This makes the new Mrs. de Winter feel small, like she doesn’t belong there, and the audience feels that too.  </p>

        <p>The lighting and set design make everything even more intense. The shadows in the halls and the giant rooms make Manderley look creepy and uncomfortable. The house feels more like a trap than a home, which shows how the new Mrs. de Winter feels stuck and out of place. Film Inquiry says, “The mise-en-scene is how a filmmaker creates meaning… to set the mood, to increase realism or surrealism, or to explore the meanings of the film’s theme” (filminquiry.com). In *Rebecca*, everything you see on screen adds to the feeling of tension and mystery, making the audience feel the same uneasiness as the main character.</p>
